## Description

The app allows you to add and delete notes.

It uses localstorage to persist.

I had problems getting the edit notes to work, I believe i would have needed to rewrite using reflux to get this to work.

I have only added basic styling so only used css.

I have only added a couple of tests, I tried to install enzyme but had issues installing on my windows 10 machine.

If I was to do this again I would write each test at the same time as I wrote the code
